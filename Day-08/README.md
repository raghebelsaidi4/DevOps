# Virtual Machines and Docker: A Comprehensive Guide

## Virtual Machines (VMs)

### What is a Virtual Machine?

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system (OS) and applications just like a physical machine but is isolated from the underlying hardware. VMs are created and managed by a **hypervisor**, which allocates hardware resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage to each VM.

### Key Features of Virtual Machines:
- **Isolation**: Each VM operates independently with its own OS.
- **Resource Sharing**: Multiple VMs share the same physical hardware.
- **Heavyweight**: VMs require a full OS installation, making them resource-intensive.
- **Use Cases**: Running multiple OS environments on a single machine, cloud computing (IaaS), and testing.

### Example of Virtual Machines in Cloud Computing:
Cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure use VMs as the foundation for their **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offerings. For example:
- AWS EC2 instances are VMs.
- Azure Virtual Machines are VMs.
- Google Compute Engine instances are VMs.

## Docker Containers

### What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in lightweight, portable containers. Unlike VMs, containers share the host machine's OS kernel, making them more efficient and faster to start.

### Key Features of Docker Containers:
- **Lightweight**: Containers share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead.
- **Portability**: Containers can run consistently across different environments.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own isolated user space.
- **Use Cases**: Microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and scalable applications.

## Docker File vs Docker Image vs Docker Container

### 1. **Dockerfile**:
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the environment, dependencies, and commands needed to run an application.

#### Example Dockerfile for a Spring Boot Application:
```Dockerfile
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application JAR file into the container
COPY target/my-spring-boot-app.jar my-spring-boot-app.jar

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "my-spring-boot-app.jar"]
```

### 2. **Docker Image**:
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Images are built from Dockerfiles.

#### Example: Building a Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t my-spring-boot-app .
```

### 3. **Docker Container**:
A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. It is isolated from other containers and the host system but shares the host OS kernel.

#### Example: Running a Docker Container
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-spring-boot-app
```

---

## Docker Build vs Docker Run

### 1. **`docker build`**:
The `docker build` command is used to create a Docker image from a Dockerfile.

#### Example:
```bash
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
```
- `-t`: Tags the image with a name and version.
- `.`: Specifies the build context (current directory).

### 2. **`docker run`**:
The `docker run` command is used to start a container from a Docker image.

#### Example:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name my-app-container my-app:1.0
```
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p`: Maps a host port to a container port.
- `--name`: Assigns a name to the container.

## Real-World Example: Dockerizing a Spring Boot Application

### Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Application
- Develop a simple Spring Boot application and package it into a JAR file using Maven or Gradle.

### Step 2: Write a Dockerfile
Create a `Dockerfile` in the project root:
```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/my-spring-boot-app.jar my-spring-boot-app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "my-spring-boot-app.jar"]
```

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t my-spring-boot-app .
```

### Step 4: Run the Docker Container
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-spring-boot-app
```

### Step 5: Access the Application
Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the Spring Boot application.
